            <p>Cameron was patient kind and an excellent teacher. He quickly adapted to my learning style and fully knew the content he was teaching. <strong>He made me go from understanding nothing in my course to acing the final exam.</strong> Even university stats seemed simple after doing lessons with him. He truly cares about his students and their performance.</p>

          <p>I don't think I'd be in university right now without him.</p>
          <div class="full-review">
            <p>Was never a big math guy. Cameron provided me clear practical instruction whilst also teaching math in a way which made me genuinely passionate about the subject. He is phenomenal at explaining fundamental concepts to beginners and exploring more elaborate problems as well. This guy saved me in high school and <strong>I don't think I'd be in university right now without him.</strong></p>

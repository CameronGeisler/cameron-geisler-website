      My name is Cameron Geisler. Based in Vancouver, Canada, I am a graduate of Honors Mathematics at the <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/">University of British Columbia</a>. My main interests are in math education. I have tutored students in mathematics since 2016.

Recently, I have been interested in:
<ul>
 	<li>Using technology for math computation, in the sense of Conrad Wolfram's book, <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=the+maths+fix+an+education+blueprint+for+the+ai+age">The Math(s) Fix: An Education Blueprint for the AI Age</a>.</li>
 	<li>Using a perspective of the historical development of mathematics, with the historical problems motivating the mathematical theory. Also, using the stories and the people of mathematics, in math education.</li>
</ul>
Besides mathematics, my hobbies include:
<ul>
 	<li>Watching hockey, being a cynical Canucks fan</li>
 	<li>Reading books, particularly non-fiction</li>
 	<li>Cooking tasty healthy food</li>
 	<li>Playing chess</li>
</ul>

      <p>I can help you achieve your academic goals with math!</p>



<p>I offer online 1-on-1 tutoring for high school and university/college. I am a graduate of the Honors Mathematics program at the University of British Columbia, with over 5 years of private tutoring experience.</p>



<p>My specializations are in:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>University prep</strong>: Helping grade 10-12 students get accepted into their desired post-secondary programs, by boosting their math grade, including Pre-calculus 12/11/10 and Calculus 12 (AP included), etc.</li>



<li><strong>Adult students</strong>: Helping returning students pass college math, who are struggling to relearn forgotten math since taking it many years ago, guiding them through the relearning process.</li>
</ul>



<p>More generally, I can help you with:</p>



<ul>
<li>Algebra, Pre-calculus, Calculus</li>



<li>Discrete Math, Intro to Mathematical Proof, Statistics</li>



<li>Other advanced topics (just ask!)</li>
</ul>



<p>We’ll meet online, using Google Meet and a virtual whiteboard.</p>



<p>I can guide you through practice questions that you are stuck on, confusing concepts, test reviews, etc.</p>



<ul>
<li>You’ll also get our lesson notes after each session, so you can review later.</li>



<li>You’ll get guidance for using Khan Academy, for personalized and targeted practice based on your knowledge gaps, and to review important prerequisites to make current topics easier.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>My rate is from $50-65/hour, depending on course level, availability, and other factors</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>I offer a free 15-30 minute session as an intro consultation</strong>, to understand your academic goals, the details of your situation, and give you an idea of how I do things.</p>



<p><strong>Use the calendar below to book the best time for you</strong>.</p>

**A lack of energy often results from a lack of action.**

There are two types of fatigue: The first kind comes from physical exhaustion, resulting from physically exerting your body for a long period of time.

The second kind is almost the opposite. It actually results from a *lack* of action, low mental and physical activity, and low dopamine in the brain.

Often, the second kind is mistaken for the first. If you've ever felt tired, then rested for a short time, and then proceeded to feel even more tired and sleepy, you know this feeling.

## A Lack of Energy
When I was in school, every vacation or break followed the same pattern. In the few weeks leading up to it, I had a feeling of anticipation and motivation, and planned what I wanted to get done.

However, when the time comes, this is quickly replaced by feelings of tiredness, a lack of energy, and lack of motivation. Every day, I would sleep in until noon, go to sleep past midnight, play video games for hours in the evening, and [spend hours scrolling social media at night](http://camerongeisler.com/smartphones-and-sleep/). This created a vicious cycle of low quality sleep and low productivity.

Then, after I finished my last courses in December 2021, I again had this same feeling. This time, I was done school (done!). However, two weeks in, I started to revert to these old habits.

## The Turnaround
Then, on Christmas day, a friend and I decided to start an exercise challenge, using [a free YouTube workout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAPCPjnU1wA). It was a simple, full-body, no-equipment, 20-minute workout–nothing compared to going to the gym. The important thing is that we agreed to do it in the morning, at 9:30am. Considering that I had spent every day of the last week waking up at around noon, this was somewhat of a challenge.

Doing this created a new feeling of energy and motivation. I felt so energized and alive every morning. I had never before been able to build a habit of morning exercise, and when I tried, it always felt exhausting and uninspiring.

As I write this, we've continued this habit every day for *45 days*. Yes, [it's everyday bro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSlb1ezRqfA). Since then, we've changed things somewhat. Now, we alternate between the [original workout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAPCPjnU1wA), and on the other day we do a [Chloe Ting workout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pLT-olgUJs) and a basic push-ups routine. Also, we now do it at 8am, instead of 9:30.

## Summary
**A lack of energy often results from a lack of action.**

Instead of viewing a lack of energy as a result of doing *too much*, realize that it is likely from doing too little.

A simple, short workout in the morning can make all the difference. How do you commit to that? Get a friend to do it with you.

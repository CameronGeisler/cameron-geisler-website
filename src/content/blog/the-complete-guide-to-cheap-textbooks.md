We all know that textbooks are massively overpriced. Here are all of my tips and resources to save the most money possible. Don't be tricked into buying textbooks from your university bookstore! There is often a digital free PDF alternative, or used books, or other options which are much cheaper.

## Free PDF Textbooks!!

There are websites that offer free PDF versions of textbooks. These two sites should be good enough to get most of the textbooks you need.

 	
- **[Libgen (Library Genesis)](https://www.libgen.is/) - **A huge database of PDF textbooks. However, it's not the most user-friendly site.
 	
- **[Z-Library](https://z-lib.is/) - **Just like Libgen, with tons of free PDF textbooks, and more generally e-books.

## Ask Your Professor!

Once you get the book list for your courses, try contacting your professor through email to ask them about the textbook. Some courses require intensive textbook use; others don’t use it at all. Ask them how much the textbook will be used, and if older editions of the textbook will work as well as the most recent edition. Your professor might not be as blunt as to say “yea you don’t need it at all” but their input can save you money! Also, it’s a misconception that professors want you to buy expensive textbooks and that they are being “paid off” by the textbook companies. In fact, it is the higher-up administrators that are in charge of all of this. Many professors are actually sympathetic to high textbook costs.

## Wait for the First Few Classes to Buy

In some classes, the professor doesn’t really want to use a textbook, but they have to put some book on the book list because of a school requirement. Typically, after going to the first couple classes, you can tell whether the textbook is required or not.

One downside to this approach is that if you do need the book, you might not get it until a week or two into the course, depending on shipping times. On the other hand, the first few weeks of a course are typically the easiest.

## More Free PDF Textbooks!

**Google**

Google your textbook's name! Try using quotation marks to match direct quotes, and use the prefix “filetype:pdf” to look specifically for pdfs. For example, if you want the textbook “Linear Algebra and its Applications” try googling:

*“linear algebra and its applications” filetype:pdf*

By playing around with different searches, you can often find what you’re looking for.

 	
- Note that some of these textbooks will only be in .djvu file format (not .pdf), so you’ll need to [convert them to pdf](https://www.google.com/search?q=convert+djvu+to+pdf) to view them using a PDF reader.

You might wonder if PDF textbooks can replace paper textbooks. In general, PDF textbooks are a good option if:

 	
- You learn just as well with digital textbooks as with physical copies (personally, I tend to prefer physical books).
 	
- You won’t need to use your textbook that often, either because you’re already pretty good at the subject, or it’s for a class you don’t absolutely need to get an A+ in.
 	
- You have a laptop, so you can use the PDF in class as a reference, and won’t have to carry a physical textbook around everywhere.

### Borrowing from the Library

One option is to borrow it from your school library, or your local public library. This can be useful if you don't need to use your textbook very often. How helpful this is will depend on how your library lets you check out and/or renew textbooks. If you can only borrow for a short time, then you could take pictures of all the necessary pages before returning it, to have them for future reference.

### Buy or Rent a Used/New Textbook

If you can’t find or don’t want a PDF textbook, used textbooks are often (but not always) cheaper than new versions. For textbooks you aren’t interested in keeping after the class is over, some websites allow rentals that are often cheaper. Note:

 	
- Remember that if you buy a textbook, you have the option to sell it after the class is over (Facebook groups, etc., see below) to reduce some of the cost. Renting doesn’t give you this option, so factor this into the overall cost.
 	
- Some websites listed actually *sell *ebook textbook rentals. Doesn’t seem like a great deal to me, but it is an option.
 	
- With rental textbooks, remember that you’ll have to return it before the due dates

[**Abebooks**](https://www.abebooks.com/)

Solid website I’ve used multiple times, especially for cheap copies of used versions of older textbooks. However, shipping times depend on the supplier and are often shipped internationally, so may be a longer wait than other sites.

**Amazon**

What *doesn’t* Amazon sell? Good for textbooks as well. New, used, and sometimes even rentals, plus they often have great shipping times.

[**Chegg**](https://www.chegg.com/)

Buy or rent both physical and ebook textbooks.

### Facebook Groups

If you don’t mind buying a textbook from another student in-person, search “(your school’s name) textbook buy and sell” on Facebook. You’ll likely find tons of other students selling books.

 	
- This is especially useful for popular first-year classes, because many first years buy new textbooks. This leaves a huge market for used versions.

[**Ebay**](https://www.ebay.com/b/Textbooks/2228/bn_2804686)

Classic buy-and-sell site also sells textbooks!

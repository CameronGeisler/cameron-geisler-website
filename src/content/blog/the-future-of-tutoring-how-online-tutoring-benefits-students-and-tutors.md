**Online tutoring has vastly improved the tutoring experience**. It allows students to learn from the comfort of their own home, in a way that is more effective, efficient, and flexible.

I’ve been doing it for a while now, especially since the 2020 pandemic, and I won’t ever go back to in-person, because it’s a win-win for both students and tutors.

**Here are the biggest reasons why:**

- **Online tutoring eliminates travel time and transportation costs, allowing more time for learning**. For my Vancouver area students, travel time ranges from 10 minutes to 1 hour. In-person, the overhead time to take off jackets, unpack backpacks, and get situated all adds up. A typical in-person [1-hour lesson](https://camerongeisler.com/why-1-hour-tutoring-sessions-are-ideal/) might have an additional 30 minutes of travel time and overhead, which is completely saved with online tutoring.

- **Online tutoring offers flexible scheduling.** Lessons can be scheduled at flexible times, because of saved travel time, and because online tutoring is location independent. I tutor students across Vancouver, neighboring cities, and even all across North America. Students can learn at home, school, the library, or even on vacation.

Other reasons online tutoring improves lessons:

- As a tutor, I can use [online tools and PDF resources](https://camerongeisler.com/math-resources/) to enhance the student's learning.

- The student doesn’t need to carry all their course materials like their textbook, computer, etc. Instead, we can send pictures of the work or use PDF resources.

- Saves gas or bus fare for the student and/or tutor, and is more environmentally friendly.

- We don’t have to cancel lessons in case of weather disruptions like snow or severe conditions in December or January.

- Avoids catching or transmitting illnesses like colds, flu, or COVID-19.

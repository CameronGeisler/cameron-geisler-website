Recall that math involves sequential learning, in that each subsequent topic builds on previous topics. In this way, paying attention in lecture is particularly essential for math classes, as missing just one point can lead to confusion for the remainder of the class. Lecture time is meant to be an intense study period, and it should be treated as such.

### Preparing for Lecture

- **Sleep habits**. Maintaining good sleep habits is important to be able to pay attention and absorb information from lecture. Of course, this goes for all classes, and especially for morning classes.
- **Pre-reading**. Read the textbook sections before lecture. The focus should be to get a general idea of the material that is about to be covered, and to try to understand as much as possible. This will help you to not get lost and behind during lecture, i.e. if you lose attention during lecture and snap back to paying attention, you won't be as lost as if you never encountered the material before. Also, pre-reading will allow you to recognize confusing points ahead of time, so you are prepared to ask questions during or after lecture.
- **Warming up before the lecture**. Try getting to lecture early (say 15 minutes early) in order to "warm up" before lecture, just as an athlete warms up before practice or a game. Some things you can do include reviewing notes from the previous lecture, reviewing the reading material, preparing questions to ask the instructor, etc. This can help refresh your memory of the material so far, making it easier to learn the new material during the lecture.

### Listening in Lecture

- **Sit in the golden triangle**. At this point, it is a "meme" that sitting closer to the front (in particular, the front row) helps you pay attention and improves learning. One reason for this is because it is quite literally easier to hear and process the auditory input from the instructor. Another reason is that it reduces distractions from other activities and from other students. For auditory learners, the middle, or the middle towards the back, can also be a spot that allows for a full view and being able to hear properly. The "golden triangle" has sides of the front row, and extends to the middle seat in the back row.
- **Focus on the instructor**. Focus on the instructor, and avoid staring at your notes (or anything else) for too long.
- **Repeat and acknowledge information**. Repeat and acknowledge information given by the instructor.

#### Note-Taking in Lecture

Math courses are unique in that writing notes on paper is still the dominant method of taking notes, as opposed to typing notes on a computer.

- **Write detailed notes**. Try to copy every step involved in the examples presented. Even if some steps seem obvious in lecture, when studying later for the test you may forget, and so it can be helpful as a reminder.
- If you get lost during a lecture, continue to take notes. Even if you can't understand in lecture, the notes can be reviewed later.
- Use question marks to indicate parts where you are confused, in order to come back to them later.
- **Use abbreviations**, for words or phrases, in order to keep things concise. This will help you not get behind.
- **Focus on concepts**. Often in math, general concepts or ideas are applied to a family of different problems.

### Reviewing Notes Post-Lecture

It is important to review notes soon after lecture. This can be done directly after class, between classes, at home later that day, or within a few days. In general, the sooner, the better. Reviewing the lecture material shortly after the lecture will help you learn and remember the material.

- **Rewrite messy notes**, to avoid being confused later on when studying for the test.
- **Fill in gaps in reasoning**. Sometimes, in lecture, you will not have time to write down everything. Fill in and expand your notes where they are incomplete.
- **Confirm your understanding of the examples done in class**.

Doing all of this can take only 5-15 minutes. The longer you wait to do this, the more likely you will forget what some parts of your notes are about. In the event you do forget some part of your notes, ask a classmate, or the instructor.

One strategy for rewriting notes is to take notes in the lecture using loose-leaf paper, and then rewrite and organize the notes in a notebook. Then, the notebook becomes the reference to study for tests.

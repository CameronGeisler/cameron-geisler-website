In 2016, I created a full video course for Pre-calculus 12, for the BC curriculum. I now offer it for free here:

[Precalculus 12 - Cameron Math](https://cameron.teachable.com/p/precalc12)

It contains over 10 hours of video explanations and examples. As of now, it is still about 95% applicable, but the school curriculum has had some minor tweaks over the years.

All the videos can be viewed for free, and if you want, you can create an account to keep track of your video progress.

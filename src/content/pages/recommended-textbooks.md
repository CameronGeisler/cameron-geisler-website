#### Calculus

There are many different calculus textbooks, depending on your mathematical maturity level.

- **[Nelson Calculus and Vectors](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mJF57F6fY6bEV-r1eXbbrcRy0YF1_2XV/view?usp=drive_link)**

Basic high school level, used in Ontario. Great for clear simple examples.

- **[Calculus - Concepts and Contexts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z7fVKwF5Q0LUXmgU9oroIpZ5_DiYsmEz/view?usp=drive_link)** (Stewart and Kokoska, 5th Edition)

More conceptual, intuitive, and applied. Great for tons of practice examples.

- [Calculus - Early Transcendentals Metric Edition](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qd1QClbFMM1-OhoOiCYfTLBFam693UQz/view?usp=sharing) (Stewart, Clegg, Watson, 9th Edition)

Calculus by Stewart is considered the classic traditional textbook. It is very thorough, but it is a bit abstract. Better for university STEM students.

- This edition uses metric units in its problems.

- [Thomas' Calculus - Early Transcendentals](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15TZgtNaIvn9AhEdpo4YeiwaobJkPp380/view?usp=sharing) (Thomas, Hass, Heil, and Bogack, 15th Edition)

Very thorough and explains nuances that other books don't, but is a bit more challenging. Also has a wide range of examples.

- **[APEX Calculus](https://opentext.uleth.ca/apex-calculus/apex-calculus.html)**

An online textbook that is deep but challenging. Better for university STEM students.

- Great book for learning multivariable calculus, especially the intuition.

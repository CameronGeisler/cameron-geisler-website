## Recommendations (Long-form)

**Vladimir**
Cameron helped me a lot tutoring me in mental math. My initial request was rather unusual for an adult person to seek mental math/arithmetic tutoring. Most of the tutors I reached out to didn't want to work with this unusual request, and I had a hard time finding the right match. When I met Cameron, he struck me with his strong positive attitude and sincere desire to help students resolve their struggles with math. He loves to teach, and I don't know how, but he makes the lessons fun. I truly enjoy studying with him — he makes things feel "natural" and generally enjoyable. I've made great progress in my mental math ability, and I would strongly recommend Cameron as a tutor.

**Kiana**
Cameron has been tutoring me for three months, and has helped me consistently achieve high marks in a high school mathematics course that I was previously struggling with. Cameron is both knowledgeable and patient making him an excellent tutor. He takes the time to not only expand on topics but also to ensure that fundamental understanding is there. Overall, Cameron has helped me expand my conceptual understanding and my fundamental skills in mathematics, helping me improve in the subject area.

**Gary**
Cameron has helped me learn deeper topics in math over the course of the last 6 months. He's really nice and is patient with you, and shows you what to do if you're really stuck. 100% recommend.

**Amelia**
As a student who has struggled in math to understand the lessons and lacks confidence in math Cameron has helped a lot to improve my grade and my confidence in taking tests and understanding the material I'm taking.

He is good at communicating and he is calm when I'm struggling to understand something. I appreciate his teaching style and easy personality.

**Little**
Cameron is hands down the best math tutor I've had at uni. He gets the hard stuff and knows how to explain it without making you feel dumb. Sessions are chill but focused. He breaks problems into tiny steps so everything clicks. If I didn't understand something, he'd try another angle until it made sense. He helped me with calculus and proofs, and my confidence went up fast. He's reliable and shows up on time. He actually cares about your progress, not just getting through the lesson. He spots gaps you didn't even know you had and gives simple examples that stick. He also teaches little exam tricks and study habits that save time when tests roll around. He's been doing this for a decade. He is truly experienced with tutoring. I can say definitively Cameron is a straight-up genius. He's worth every penny. I love you Cameron!

**Bob**
Cameron is seriously the best tutor I've ever had. He's really good at breaking things down so they actually make sense. And really patient and kept me focused on the material. My calculus grade went from a ~80% to a 92% in the end, and I honestly couldn't have done it without him.

**Amelia** (AP Calculus)
I had the best experience working with Cameron during my senior year while taking AP Calculus. At the beginning of the school year, I actually tried out a few different tutors, he was the third one I worked with, and by far the best. He stood out immediately because of how clearly he explained things, and he was the only one I continued with for the rest of the year, and I'm so glad I did. He is incredibly knowledgeable and helped me work through the areas I really struggled with. His explanations were very clear, he would write out his work so I could understand the processes clearly and he was very patient with me. Thanks to his support, I felt confident and well-prepared going into the AP exam, and I ended up getting credits, which I am extremely happy about! He's not only super smart, but also extremely kind, friendly, and encouraging. He always took the time to make sure I really understood each concept and would reteach sections I learnt at school that I did not understand at all. He even mentioned that I can reach out again once I'm in university if I need help, which just shows how committed he is to his students. I would absolutely recommend him to anyone needing help with math, especially AP Calculus. Truly one of the best tutors I've had!
